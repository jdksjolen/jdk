The issue discussed in vm-result-issue.txt made us realize that the use of
_vm_result across Java calls is also a problem for Loom. As _vm_result is
logically part of the virtual thread's execution state, but stored in the carrier
thread, it means we must not be able to switch virtual threads whilst the
field is in use. Initially we thought this would not be an issue for monitor exit
as we don't block releasing a monitor, but that may not be true. In Loom when we
unpark a waiting thread so it can acquire the now free monitor, it is conceptually
possible that we could switch to that newly unparked virtual thread! That would
cause a breakage.
